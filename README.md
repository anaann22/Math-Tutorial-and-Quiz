Project Title: Math For You

Description:
This mobile application is designed to help middle school students improve their mathematical skills and learn through an interactive game. The main purpose of the application is to provide a fun and engaging way to practice and reinforce basic mathematical knowledge.

Key Features:
1. Diverse Questions: The app includes a variety of math questions tailored to the difficulty level of middle school students. These questions cover various mathematical concepts, including geometry, arithmetic, algebra, and practical problems.

2. Intuitive Interface: The app's interface is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive for students. It incorporates visually appealing elements such as images and graphics to enhance the learning experience.

3. Interactive Game: Students can answer questions by selecting a response from multiple options. The app provides immediate feedback on the correct answer and allows users to advance to the next question. Scores are calculated in real-time and displayed throughout the game.

4. Results and Progress: At the end of the game, students can view their obtained score.

5. Motivation and Rewards: The app also offers motivational elements and rewards to encourage participation and learning. For instance, students can achieve a maximum score and receive a congratulatory message for their achievements.

6. Flexibility and Portability: The app is available on mobile devices, allowing students to learn anywhere and anytime. This provides flexibility in usage and can be tailored to the specific needs of each student.

Benefits:
- Improvement of mathematical skills: Through this interactive game, students can practice and reinforce mathematical concepts.

How the App Works:
1. The user selects the grade level they are interested in.
2. After choosing the grade level, they have the option to select between studying or taking a practice quiz (for grades 5-7).
3. The study section consists of PDFs with theory and solved exercises (for grades 5-7).
4. The quiz section consists of random questions with real-time scoring, providing the user with feedback based on their performance (for grades 5-7).
5. For 8th grade, an exam section is implemented. The user accesses a specific year of examination, where they can see the test, and after completing it, they can view the scoring rubric.
